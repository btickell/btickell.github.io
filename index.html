	<h1>Hi there, I'm Blake Tickell!</h1>
	<p>I'm a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a degree in Computer Science and Statistics working with Professor Pulkit Agrawal at MIT's CSAIL on learned exploration strategies and utilizing touch sensing in dextrous learning. Prior to coming to MIT, I worked at LBNL on interpretability of generative climate models in the hopes of making salient environmental predictions.
